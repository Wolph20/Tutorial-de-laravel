    This type of statistical model (also known as logit model) is often used
    for classification and predictive analytics. Logistic regression estimates
    the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn’t vote, based
    on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a
    probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1. In
    logistic regression, a logit transformation is applied on the odds—that
    is, the probability of success divided by the probability of failure.
    This is also commonly known as the log odds, or the natural logarithm of
    odds, and this logistic function is represented by the following formulas:

    Logit(pi) = 1/(1+ exp(-pi))

    ln(pi/(1-pi)) = Beta_0 + Beta_1*X_1 + … + B_k*K_k

    In this logistic regression equation, logit(pi) is the dependent or response
    variable and x is the independent variable. The beta parameter, or coefficient,
    in this model is commonly estimated via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).
    This method tests different values of beta through multiple iterations to
    optimize for the best fit of log odds. All of these iterations produce the
    log likelihood function, and logistic regression seeks to maximize this function
    to find the best parameter estimate. Once the optimal coefficient (or coefficients
    if there is more than one independent variable) is found, the conditional
    probabilities for each observation can be calculated, logged, and summed together
    to yield a predicted probability. For binary classification, a probability less
    than .5 will predict 0 while a probability greater than 0 will predict 1.  After
    the model has been computed, it’s best practice to evaluate the how well the model
    predicts the dependent variable, which is called goodness of fit. The Hosmer–Lemeshow
    test is a popular method to assess model fit.
